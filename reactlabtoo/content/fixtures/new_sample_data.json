But with plenty of ice cream shops in Harvard Square, which is the best one to go to? Read on to find out the vibe of each shop and what to expect there.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Ben &amp; Jerry&rsquo;s: Craving a Classic</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ben &amp; Jerry&rsquo;s is located at 35 JFK St., and a convenient dessert option right next to Sweetgreen! Although this shop has a reputation for being overrated and overpriced, there&rsquo;s no doubt it has the most consistent ice cream quality. With a variety of flavors from Americone Dream to Strawberry Cheesecake, there&rsquo;s surely something for everyone. It is important to note that though the ice cream here is the highest of quality, there&rsquo;s no indoor seating, so its deliciousness quickly melts away.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>J.P. Licks: Wanting it All</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>J.P. Licks is located at 1312 Massachusetts Ave., within view of the main entrance of the Smith Campus Center. This shop truly seems to be a Harvard staple &mdash; students can consistently be spotted completing work at the front bar-style seating area. J.P. Licks also has a sizable amount of seating available for customers, ranging from bar-style window seats and indoor seating to outdoor tables. The iconic Boston has numerous ice cream flavors to choose from, as well as the option to purchase a &ldquo;Make at Home Kit&rdquo; for crafting your own sundaes and ice cream sandwiches. Even better, the shop itself has a very cozy and cute aesthetic thanks to its animated cow logo and consistent color scheme of pink and black.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Lizzy&rsquo;s Ice Cream: Finding a Hidden Gem</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lizzy&rsquo;s Ice Cream is located at 29 Church St., near Pokeworks. It&rsquo;s a rather small shop with essentially no seating, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean it&rsquo;s not worth a visit. Lizzy&rsquo;s has a vast array of ice cream flavors including chocolate ice cream with cookie dough pieces, although it has the classic cookie dough (made with vanilla ice cream) as well! Lizzy&rsquo;s Harvard Square location has a unique flavor called Charles River Crunch, which is a play on the neverending Harvard and Cambridge niche.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>BerryLine: Keeping it Simple</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>BerryLine is located at 3 Arrow St., right behind Zinneken&#39;s. Why not follow a waffle dinner with an ice cream dessert? BerryLine is a rather hidden shop &mdash; it&rsquo;s bigger than Lizzy&rsquo;s but smaller than J.P. Licks with a small amount of indoor seating looking out to the front of the shop. When it comes to ice cream and frozen yogurt, BerryLine has a smaller range of flavors than the other shops, but there&rsquo;s definitely still something for everyone. Their flavors are on constant rotation, so you will have the chance to find new favorite flavors and spice up your palate. Also, it&rsquo;s the first shop on the list with real fruit as a topping option!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Shake Shack: Wanting a Wild Card</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Shake Shack is located at 29 Church St., right by Peet&rsquo;s Coffee. Is this actually an ice cream shop? No. But the frozen custard is amazing. Amidst their plentiful seating and choices of vanilla or chocolate frozen custard, an ice cream craving can be easily quenched here. This custard is a million times better than run-of-the-mill vanilla or chocolate ice cream that can be found everywhere else.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&mdash;Staff Writer Hailey E.

As the showrunner of &ldquo;Diary of a Future President&rdquo; on Disney+, she often reflects on her past in order to look toward the future.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A former &ldquo;theater kid,&rdquo; Pe&ntilde;a has always been interested in the arts. She spent her childhood acting in plays, but she first became interested in directing at age thirteen when she took a video class at Belvoir Terrace, a summer camp that &ldquo;nurtured all aspects of the arts.&rdquo; While creating her first short film at camp, she discovered a passion for creating stories and working on multiple aspects of them to bring them to life. Then, as a theater major at Northwestern University, Pe&ntilde;a explored various interests within her field and soon fell in love with playwriting. It was only after taking a course in writing for television during her senior year of college, however, that Pe&ntilde;a found the area of work that most excited her and best suited her interests.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Everything that I loved about theater and everything that I started to really love about film and &hellip; running around with a camera at camp clicked with TV. It was collaborative; it was character-driven,&rdquo; Pe&ntilde;a said. She knew then it was what she wanted to dedicate herself to.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After graduation, Pe&ntilde;a sought to continue the momentum she had built in college. She was used to creating and leading projects and she had the experience and skills for it, but &ldquo;nobody cared.&rdquo; While she struggled to find a job at first, she used the extra time she had to develop her craft and find her footing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;This time allowed me to write my not-as-good drafts of things that luckily nobody saw, but also take a beat and figure out what I wanted to do,&rdquo; Pe&ntilde;a said in reflection.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Breaking into the television industry, Pe&ntilde;a worked her way up by verbalizing her goals. She worked on a handful of shows before becoming the showrunner&rsquo;s assistant on The CW series &ldquo;Crazy Ex-Girlfriend.&rdquo; Still, she was determined to be a writer and was unafraid to ask for the role. By the fourth season of &ldquo;Crazy Ex-Girlfriend,&rdquo; her tenacity had paid off: She was promoted to a staff writer position on the show.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;You have to be loud and specific about what you want,&rdquo; she said of her success strategy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Drawn by her success, agents soon approached her seeking a new comedy. She was tasked with creating a story that was fully her own. Having grown up watching &ldquo;Boy Meets World&rdquo; and &ldquo;Lizzie McGuire,&rdquo; Pe&ntilde;a knew she wanted to create a coming-of-age show with a protagonist similar to herself, a Cuban-American girl from Miami. And so she began writing &ldquo;Diary of a Future President,&rdquo; a comedy-drama series currently streaming on Disney+.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;The image I had when I was coming up with the idea was of a young Latina girl like &lsquo;this&rsquo; on the side of a bus,&rdquo; said Pe&ntilde;a, smiling and displaying a folded-arms, shoulders-back, confident power pose.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With &ldquo;Diary,&rdquo; Pe&ntilde;a had the opportunity to create stories in the way she sought to since making the short film at camp. As a showrunner, she accounted for details across all aspects of the show &mdash; including working with the costume designer, writing new scripts, deciding how loud a phone sound effect should be &mdash; and she loved working with the crew of &ldquo;passionate, motivated experts.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pe&ntilde;a believes that storytelling through television is &ldquo;literal magic.&rdquo; &ldquo;I have not lost the stars in my eyes,&rdquo; she said of her enthusiasm for the craft.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even still, she encountered challenges while working on the show.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Diary&rdquo; was widely perceived as a &ldquo;Latinx show,&rdquo; a label that Pe&ntilde;a resists. She felt pressure to represent an entire culture, even though the story was simply inspired by her own childhood. The show follows a young Latina girl, yes, but at its core it is a story about growing up: having a first crush, forgetting about homework, and fighting with one&rsquo;s siblings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even though it was canceled after only two seasons, Pe&ntilde;a wouldn&rsquo;t change much if she had the chance to go back in time to work on &ldquo;Diary&rdquo; again &mdash; she would only encourage her past self to have more confidence in her abilities and instincts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;I actually do know what I&rsquo;m doing. And the stuff I don&rsquo;t know, I can learn and will learn,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;But being confident in my own skin, owning the fact that I&rsquo;m a creator, owning the fact that I&rsquo;m an executive producer, and owning the fact that this is my story&hellip; if I could go back in time, I would own that a little bit earlier.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Diary of a Future President&rdquo; thrived when Pe&ntilde;a&rsquo;s confidence thrived, which she compared to her memory of filming at camp. She cites &ldquo;unbridled confidence&rdquo; and belief in herself as necessary qualities she continues to channel after her work on the show ended.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;You have to own what you want; you have to proclaim it,&rdquo; said Pe&ntilde;a. Especially in the television industry, people are often willing to help but cannot read minds. She advised, &ldquo;people have to know that you want something, and they have to know what it is that you want.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pe&ntilde;a&rsquo;s outstanding career is fueled by her ability to ask for what she wants &mdash; and she is not done yet. She has much ahead of her, including two potential shows and a few feature films. &ldquo;I want to make things, I want to keep writing, directing, and producing, but I also want to use my little corner to empower other voices as well,&rdquo; she said. Inspired by the encouraging mentors and supportive bosses who helped her in her own journey, she is committed to nurturing the talents of emerging writers going forward.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;I feel so lucky to finally be in the room and finally be at the table that I&rsquo;ve been dreaming of being at since I was thirteen years old and running around with a camera. I hope that from my little corner I can make access a little bit easier for people who are trying to break in [to the television industry]. I want to elevate voices that aren&rsquo;t just mine,&rdquo; Pe&ntilde;a said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d love to empower people the way that I was lucky enough to be empowered when I was starting out.&rdquo;</p>", "created_on": "2022-04-22T01:05:51.231733Z", "slug": "ilana-pena-artist-profile", "contributors": [1]}}, {"model": "content.article", "pk": 5, "fields": {"title": "Creative Writing Collective Organizes South Asian Poetry Series", "text": "<p>{image id=1344642 align=left size=large byline=true caption=true}</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From the end of March through last week, the Harvard Creative Writing Collective held a series of poetry readings hosted by South Asian authors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The South Asian Poetry Series invited poets of South Asian descent to travel to campus, hold readings of their work, and join in on dinners with students and faculty.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Isabel T. Mehta &rsquo;24, the main organizer of the series, said she was first inspired to put on the readings when she heard her professor Vidyan Ravinthiran, who teaches English, read one of his poems for the CWC.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;I was blown away because I was in the presence of a South Asian person reading the poetry that they had written professionally,&rdquo; Mehta said. &ldquo;Being exposed to a South Asian person with a similar background as mine who has done this for their career was just kind of mind-blowing.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ravinthiran helped Mehta organize the events but gave credit to Mehta for bringing the poets to Cambridge.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;When we have a reading, I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;ll really enjoy it,&quot; Ravinthiran said. &quot;But it&rsquo;s absolutely her achievement, and I think that should be made clear.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To organize the first event in the series, Ravinthiran put Mehta in touch with poet Srikanth Reddy &rsquo;95, who agreed to read his work to the group. Mehta said many poets were eager to take part in the series when invited.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s the other thing, poets don&rsquo;t get a lot of attention &mdash; even the really, really good ones &mdash; and so they respond really quickly to emails and they respond to everything,&rdquo; Mehta said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mehta also expressed disillusionment with the accessibility of creative writing spaces in general within the College.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;This is something that&rsquo;s very important: being a creative writer at Harvard can be a very disheartening thing because most of the spaces that allow you to create, to do creative writing are very exclusive,&rdquo; Mehta said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In response to her observations of exclusion, Mehta joined the CWC and organized these events to create a more inclusive space and increase visibility for South Asians in fields like English.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t we try and bring more of these people out?&rdquo; Mehta said. &ldquo;Not just from Harvard, but try to bring them from other areas.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Aarya A. Kaushik &rsquo;24, a Creative Writing Collective board member, said the poetry series included optional dinners with the poets before each poetry reading.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;It was just a wonderful experience to get to see these poets in a more casual environment before going to the poetry reading and also getting to know them a little bit better,&rdquo; Kaushik said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kaushik said the poetry series was successful due to the support from both Creative Writing Collective members and students across Harvard&rsquo;s campus.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been really pleased and a little bit surprised, but pleasantly surprised to see the turnout is definitely not just the Creative Writing Collective,&rdquo; Kaushik said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve seen lots of people from campus and even more than that, not just South Asian students or diasporic students on campus, but students from all different heritages coming to these poetry readings.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The collective may continue the poetry series given the success of this semester&rsquo;s iteration, according to Kaushik.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;We would always love to hear them read some of their works again,&rdquo; Kaushik added. &ldquo;Two hours seems like a lot of time but it honestly flew by with those poets, so we&rsquo;d love to have more events with them, as well as maybe continue the South Asian poetry speaker series.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&mdash;Staff writer Ella L.

What&rsquo;s not to love about period dramas? Whether it be &ldquo;Bridgerton&rdquo; or classic BBC period television dramas such as &ldquo;Pride and Prejudice,&rdquo; it is clear that the obsession for period dramas stems from the paradoxical nostalgia of romanticizing history.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Many newer fans of the genre have been introduced to period films through the hit television show, which made period pieces a household obsession: &ldquo;Bridgerton.&rdquo; According to <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2021/01/bridgerton-netflix-biggest-hit-highest-ratings-female-audiences-romance\">Netflix</a>, &ldquo;82 million households around the world chose to watch Bridgerton in its first 28 days.&rdquo; Bridgerton, among decades&rsquo; worth of Regency-esque adaptations, proved to be successful because it did one thing that other period pieces shied away from: it implemented a distinctly modern adaptation of the British Regency era.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Bridgerton&rdquo;&rsquo;s early audiences were excited to see what a modern period television show would look like, especially given Netflix&rsquo;s seemingly infinite budget. To audiences&rsquo; surprise, this meant an instrumental cover of Billy Elish&rsquo;s &ldquo;Bad Guy&rdquo; during the first ball of the season among other surprises. While &ldquo;Bridgerton&#39;&#39; and its references to modernity allow more people to relate to the genre, not every cross-period integration seems necessary.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Firstly, the soundtrack of &ldquo;Bridgerton&rdquo; incorporates modern pop songs at the worst possible times &mdash; muddling the more traditional soundtrack with random hit songs that don&rsquo;t fit the regency setting. While the costume design in &ldquo;Bridgerton&rdquo; has received<a href=\"https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/bridgerton/s01\"> mass praise</a>, it can still lack creativity and authenticity. The show specifically connects characters and their families to specific color schemes, and although this makes it easier to identify them, this design scheme became dull over the course of two seasons.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All criticisms aside, some of the best period pieces adapt Jane Austen&rsquo;s classics. Whether you watch Joe Wright&rsquo;s &ldquo;Pride and Prejudice&rdquo; (2005) or BBC&rsquo;s adaptation of the same title, the idyllic English country-side cinematography and a sensational soundtrack is impossible not to enjoy. &ldquo;Emma.&rdquo; (2020) is another amazing example of a period film that incorporates subtle modern influences into the personality and costume design of the characters. The film is distinguished by its commitment to a bright aesthetic, as seen in Emma&rsquo;s flashy mustard yellow gown and extravagant black hat with yellow feathers seen in the movie poster. Austen&rsquo;s stories are timeless &mdash; pining young lovers and troves of slow-burn miscommunication, making them perfect for subtle artistic exploration. Their well-loved narratives are themselves beautiful works of art, and directors simply have to aesthetically match Austen&#39;s subtle wit and charm.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Though these period dramas provide 21st-century viewers with the opportunity to daydream in and experience the aesthetics of the Regency era without actually having to witness the not-so-glamorous aspects of the nineteenth century, such as large, grimy farms or the tribulations of the working classes. These dramas intentionally focus on families from the wealthiest social class, allowing them to illustrate an image of glamor and idyllic settings to the viewers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As a result, these films simplify and romanticize the realities of the Regency era to the modern audience. These pieces allow watchers to lose themselves in the simplicity of the Regency era. Despite fallbacks in adapting modern music and flat costume design, the emergence of more period dramas are instrumental in enticing new audiences to the genre and creating an obsession around these pieces that is nearly impossible to ignore.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n&mdash;Staff writer Monique I.

Several pre-frosh will brave dorm life and stay with current undergrads, who will graciously host them for the weekend. Here&rsquo;s Flyby Blog&rsquo;s do&rsquo;s and don&rsquo;ts list for prefrosh and their hosts to avoid any and all drama.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>For the Prefrosh&hellip;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><u><strong>DO: Ask your host about Harvard life</strong></u></p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you&rsquo;re still debating which college to attend or want to learn more about the Harvard experience, use your host as a resource! They can give you all the nitty gritty information admissions officers won&rsquo;t. Questions to avoid: Do you like Tasty Burger Basement? What was your SAT score? Are you excited to live in the Quad? </p>\r\n\r\n<p><u><strong>DON&rsquo;T: Follow your host around.</strong></u></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Your hosts volunteered to host you because they want to welcome admitted students to the Harvard community &mdash; but remember your host has finals soon, and their job is not to babysit you. Instead, ask for recommendations: which classic Harvard restaurants should you try? Are the coffee and pastries better at Tatte or Flour? Is Jefe&rsquo;s better than Felipe&rsquo;s? (though this might get heated). </p>\r\n\r\n<p><u><strong>DO: Connect with other prefrosh.</strong></u></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Who knows, maybe you&rsquo;ll find your new best friend at Visitas (although we can&rsquo;t guarantee that any Visitas hook-ups will last). Invite one of the people you awkwardly DM&rsquo;d over Instagram because they had Harvard &rsquo;26 in their bio to grab Nochs with you! </p>\r\n\r\n<p><u><strong>DON&rsquo;T: Make your host&rsquo;s dorm extra messy. </strong></u></p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is nothing worse than a guest who flings their belongings everywhere. Harvard dorms are small to begin with, so try to keep your space neat and tidy! Make sure to clean up after yourself and leave the dorm exactly how you found it. </p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>For the Hosts&hellip;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><u><strong>DON&rsquo;T: Let your guest sit alone in your room, unsure of what to do. </strong></u></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Help them choose the best events to go to or give them recommendations of which Harvard spots they need to check out. Help them connect with other prefrosh and be the host you would want to have had during Visitas!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><u><strong>DO: Give them a personalized tour of campus!</strong></u></p>\r\n\r\n<p>What is unique about your Harvard experience that only you could show them? Take your guest(s) to your favorite study spot in Cabot Library or Smith Campus Center, or perhaps show them the dance studio you spend hours in. Introduce them to the best latte at Pavement &mdash; show them the things that the admissions tour will not! </p>\r\n\r\n<p><u><strong>DON&rsquo;T: Act too busy for your guest. </strong></u></p>\r\n\r\n<p>You signed up for this! I know we all have finals coming up soon, but make sure to set aside time to get to know your guest and answer any questions they may have about Harvard. There&rsquo;s nothing worse than feeling like a burden or being ignored.

Miccioli said the purpose of the week is to &ldquo;draw attention to the conditions which Palestinians have to live under in both Israel and the occupied territories.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Israel is practicing the crime of apartheid, so our goal is to draw attention to those conditions, to try and advocate, of course, that Israel follow international law and afford equal rights to all people regardless of their race or their religion, and to try and build solidarity and awareness in the general Harvard population,&rdquo; he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The week kicked off with a panel on Black Palestinian Solidarity, which featured columnist Margaret Kimberley and Hella Black Podcast co-host Abbas Muntaqim. Chomsky headlined another event Wednesday, which had more than 60 virtual attendees, in addition to an in-person crowd in Harvard Hall.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Roughly 20 participants attended Tuesday&rsquo;s virtual Queer Palestinian Panel, which featured Palestinian singer Bashar Murad, Palestinian activist and social media influencer Lama, and Emory University associate professor Sa&rsquo;ed Atshan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The panelists discussed the concept of &ldquo;pinkwashing,&rdquo; which Atshan defined as &ldquo;a propaganda discourse that supporters of the right-wing Israeli state use to draw attention to a purported advanced LGBTQ rights record in Israel in order to detract attention away from Israel&rsquo;s violations of Palestinian human rights.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;We know homophobia exists everywhere. It exists in Palestine. It exists in Israel,&rdquo; Murad said. &ldquo;It exists all over the world, but it doesn&rsquo;t justify any of the oppression that Palestinians are going through.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Earlier in the week, the PSC placed an art installation between the freshman dorms of Canaday and Thayer meant to represent the Israeli West Bank barrier. The &ldquo;Wall of Resistance&rdquo; consists of six painted panels, which included the phrases &ldquo;Free Palestine&rdquo; and &ldquo;Boycott! Divest! Sanctions!&rdquo; referring to the international movement to withhold economic support from Israel.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The installation features a quote from writer and civil rights activist Audre Lorde, &ldquo;Your silence will not protect you.&rdquo; Another panel reads in all capital letters, &ldquo;Zionism is Racism Settler Colonialism White Supremacy Apartheid.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In response to IAW, Harvard Hillel organized a &ldquo;Stand with Israel Rally&rdquo; on Wednesday calling on Harvard affiliates and the public to &ldquo;take a stand against the anti-Israel apartheid week.&rdquo; Roughly 40 people gathered in Harvard Yard in support.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hillel&rsquo;s student president, Natalie L. Kahn &rsquo;23, said in an interview at the rally that she felt IAW&rsquo;s approach lacked nuance and that the art installation was offensive to students.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;For our students to have to walk outside their room everyday and see these very reductive and libelous statements that are calling Zionism racism and Zionism apartheid and Zionism white supremacy &mdash; which is something deeply, deeply offensive to the Jewish people who, by the way, had been targeted by white supremacists throughout years &mdash; is disgusting,&rdquo; said Kahn, a Crimson news editor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>{image id=1340713 align=center size=large byline=true caption=&rdquo;Harvard Hillel, a center for Jewish life on campus, is located on Mt. Auburn St. in Cambridge.&rdquo;}</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rabbi Jonah C. Steinberg, executive director of Harvard Hillel, sent an email to Hillel affiliates on Wednesday denouncing the rhetoric of IAW participants.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Long-discredited tropes such as &lsquo;Zionism = Racism&rsquo; and absurdities such as &lsquo;Zionism = White Supremacy,&rsquo; as we have seen billboarded in the heart of Harvard this week, on a huge anti-Israel display in the Yard, are beneath the intelligence and the truth-seeking inquisitiveness one expects of Harvard students,&rdquo; Steinberg said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He also condemned the art installation as one that &ldquo;can be explained only in terms of a frothing vitriol that verges left and right on outright antisemitism.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Harvard Israel Initiative, a Hillel program, called the IAW events &ldquo;devoid of any attempt at dialogue or complexity&rdquo; in a Tuesday statement. Hillel&rsquo;s Student Board also released a statement criticizing IAW&rsquo;s language.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>IAW organizer Nadine S. Bahour &rsquo;22 said that she always &ldquo;expects&rdquo; opposition and hopes the events will start a conversation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;I love how Harvard is a space on campus where everyone can organize their events and also feel comfortable speaking up about what they object to with other student organization events,&rdquo; Bahour said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Miccioli pushed back on the claim that calling Israel an apartheid state is anti-semitic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re trying to conflate criticism of the state of Israel with anti-semitism. We have Jewish members in our organization. We had Jewish speakers come speak at our events, so I don&rsquo;t think that their response has been very convincing,&rdquo; he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bahour said that her favorite part of IAW&rsquo;s programming has been the Wall of Resistance in Harvard Yard.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;The panels are all very powerful and they really show a lot of solidarity, because they&#39;re not all about Palestine,&rdquo; Bahour said. &ldquo;Each one covers a different topic and is trying to show that the Palestinian cause doesn&#39;t exist in a bubble, but it&#39;s rather very interconnected with our everyday life here in the U.S.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The week&rsquo;s programming will conclude Friday with a discussion featuring speakers from Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, and Harvard Law School.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&mdash; Staff Writer Ella L.

A hit since its release in 2018, &ldquo;Killing Eve&rdquo; is an edgy drama-slash-thriller following MI5 employee Eve Polastri (Sandra Oh) and the cat and mouse game with glamorous Russian assassin Villanelle (Jodie Comer) that she soon finds herself entangled in.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While &ldquo;Killing Eve&rdquo;&rsquo;s final episode in many ways could have been worse, it still left a lot to be desired. Rather than capitalizing on the bold elements the show is known and loved for, the finale is, for the most part, mediocre. Not only is the fate of Villanelle and Eve unsatisfying, but the episode in general is a rather gray (both literally and figuratively) and unexciting end to an otherwise dynamic series.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The finale stays true to some distinctly &ldquo;Killing Eve&rdquo; qualities, which were able to be appreciated one last time. Viewers can spend the final episode enjoying the grand scenic landscapes of the show&rsquo;s various settings, the block letter location labels and signature dripping title scene, and unrestrained portrayals of violence and gore. There&rsquo;s nothing quite like seeing a character&rsquo;s eyes be gouged and popped on camera.) To a respectable degree, the show has also managed to retain its characteristic offbeat humor, and its morally-questionable characters still remain their same lovable selves throughout.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This episode &mdash; and Season Four as a whole &mdash; are noticeably underwhelming in aesthetic terms when compared to previous seasons. The majority of the action in this season takes place in dreary, overcast locations (which in itself is not the end of the world) but is disappointing when compared to the vibrant, chic scenery of Paris, Barcelona, and other cities that appeared in seasons past. Perhaps the choice to limit the variety and vibrancy of locations is a deliberate choice that mirrors Villanelle and Eve&rsquo;s gradual journey towards living settled civilian lives. For a show all about a glamorous international assassin, however, the gray demeanor of Season Four feels less like an unfavorable aesthetic choice and more like a hit to an aspect of the show that, up to this point, had been one of the many things that made the series special.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The performances of the cast are consistently stellar, however. Sandra Oh&rsquo;s Eve, Fiona Shaw&rsquo;s Carolyn Martens, and Kim Bodnia&rsquo;s Constantin Vasiliev have brought immense depth and impeccable comedic timing to &ldquo;Killing Eve&rdquo; since Season One. And Jodie Comer occupies a category all her own: her brilliance would shine in just about anything, but the nature of &ldquo;Killing Eve&rdquo; has given her unique room to play that she has taken full advantage of. The mild-mannered Liverpudlian is almost unrecognizable on screen: Her entire demeanor transforms as she not only portrays the flamboyant, charismatic Russian assassin Villanelle, but also shifts in and out of Villanelle&rsquo;s various accents, personas, and false identities. Comer is an unforgettable lead from beginning to end &mdash; making a psychopathic killer a genuinely adored fan favorite &mdash; and makes the series worth finishing despite the questionable quality of its finale.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even the best actors cannot save bad writing, though. Each season of &ldquo;Killing Eve&rdquo; thus far has had a different head writer, with screenwriter Laura Neal taking over as the anchor for this leg of the relay. The impression the script gave off, however, was that of resignation. For the most part, loose ends were tied. But they were tied in the simplest and least remarkable of knots, many of which were underdeveloped character deaths. H&eacute;l&egrave;ne, one of the highest-ranking members of the shadowy anarchist organization The Twelve, is swiftly assassinated (this plot decision is perhaps the most forgivable, as this character had only recently been given a bigger role to play). Constantin &mdash; a long-running central character &mdash; is also murdered without fanfare over a minor misunderstanding and bleeds out on the floor in a plot sequence that is given little heed elsewhere in the show.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And of course, The Twelve themselves are killed. The series attempts to frame this showdown as dramatic, but it ultimately falls flat. Since Season One, The Twelve have appeared omnipotent and omniscient, mercilessly punishing and eliminating anyone who crosses them, all while remaining untraceable by authorities &mdash; not to mention that they have caused Villanelle and Eve a whole lot of grief over the years. And yet, they are all slaughtered off-screen during a music montage as Eve dances her heart out at a wedding reception on the deck above. Though this quick and painless resolution is good news for Villanelle and Eve, it could not be more anticlimactic for the viewer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One redeeming aspect of the finale that must be addressed is that it finally gives the people what they have been asking for: Villaneve. After years of teasing a relationship between Eve and Villanelle, the finale delivers on this front with a real kiss &mdash; one that is not hasty, a surprise to either party, or on a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_UnDvDcnmg\">moving bus</a>. And for about 20 minutes, viewers are allowed the rare pleasure of seeing Eve and Villanelle enjoy a few moments of peace as a couple. For the dedicated fan, this is a win that cannot be overstated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Unfortunately, the consummation of the Villaneve relationship is too little, too late. This brings up the elephant in the room: Villanelle&rsquo;s death. The scene itself is quite stunning, with both Eve and Villanelle suspended in the water of the Thames, reaching for each other in a manner reminiscent of Michelangelo&rsquo;s &ldquo;The Creation of Adam.&rdquo; The actual circumstances of the murder, however, are much less satisfying. Although fans would have likely preferred that both protagonists survive, the least the show could have done was allow Villanelle a sendoff consistent with her distinct flair and dramatics. Instead, she &mdash; who has evaded death time and again &mdash; is abruptly finished off by an unseen sniper. It also appears that Carolyn, the legendary Head of the Russia Desk at MI6, orchestrated the murder for unexplained reasons, and this lack of clarity only further detracts from the finale&rsquo;s effectiveness.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Villanelle&rsquo;s death is not only upsetting for fans of the character, but it is also troublesome in the fact that it is yet another instance of unhappy endings for lesbians in media. From &ldquo;The 100&rdquo; to &ldquo;Portrait of a Lady on Fire&rdquo; to &ldquo;The World to Come,&rdquo; one is hard-pressed to find many lesbian relationships in film or TV that don&rsquo;t end in separation at best, or death at worst. Unfortunately, &ldquo;Killing Eve&rdquo; &mdash; though some viewers were brave enough to hope that the show would avoid this fate &mdash; becomes only the most recent victim of the <a href=\"https://the-take.com/watch/the-bury-your-gays-trope-explained\">&ldquo;bury your gays&rdquo;</a> trope.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Overall, it has been a pleasure to watch the series over these past few years. Its superb cast and visual brilliance are enough to justify viewing it in full, and, despite its general decline over Seasons Three and Four, it has still solidified its place among the top ranks of television. It is sad, then, to see it fumble in the home stretch. Above all, the mediocrity of the finale feels like a betrayal to the bold, unapologetic nature of the series &mdash; if you&rsquo;re not going to be fantastic, at least be terrible and unashamed! Like that of Villanelle and many other characters, &ldquo;Killing Eve&rdquo;&rsquo;s life ended without fanfare and without a sense of catharsis &mdash; a lukewarm, resigned ending to a show that was once full of zest and energy.</p>", "created_on": "2022-04-22T01:01:43.497154Z", "slug": "killing-eve-series-finale-review", "contributors": [12]}}, {"model": "content.article", "pk": 12, "fields": {"title": "In-Person Visitas Set to Return After Two-Year Hiatus", "text": "<p>{image id=1356019 align=left size=large byline=true caption=true}</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After welcoming the past two undergraduate classes to Harvard virtually, the College will greet admitted students in the Class of 2026 during the first in-person Visitas weekend since 2019, set to begin Sunday.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Visitas, an annual program bringing admitted students to the College&rsquo;s campus for a weekend, was held <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2020/3/7/harvard-visitas-cancelled/\">online for the Class of 2024</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2021/4/21/frosh-like-virtual-visitas/\">Class of 2025</a>.

The Crimson (5-6, 3-2 Ivy League) traveled to the Big Apple for a Saturday afternoon showdown with the Columbia Lions (2-10, 0-4 Ivy League). Despite the score being knotted at six apiece halfway through the contest, Harvard came out firing on all cylinders in the second half, outscoring the Lions 8-2, with streaks of three and five straight unanswered goals. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>This was an important win for the Crimson, not only because the team demonstrated that it can play as well as anyone once things start clicking, but also because the victory allowed Harvard to attain fourth place in the Ivy League as the season enters its final stretch.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Currently, Yale (9-2, 5-0 Ivy League) sits atop the conference, with No. 12 Princeton (8-3, 3-0 Ivy League) sitting just behind the Bulldogs. The team separating the Crimson from the top two is Cornell (7-6, 3-2 Ivy League). Although Harvard and the Big Red share identical conference records, Cornell owns the head-to-head matchup, just narrowly sneaking out of Cambridge with a 10-9 victory that took two overtimes to cement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Additionally, had Harvard dropped this matchup against Columbia, it would have allowed Brown (5-7, 2-3 Ivy League) &ndash; the Crimson&rsquo;s final regular season opponent this season &ndash; to share control over fourth place in the Ivy League. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>This was also a much needed win for Harvard since, despite picking up an 11-7 win over Dartmouth (3-8, 1-4 Ivy League) a week after the double-overtime thriller against Cornell, the Crimson suffered another bout of crushing defeats. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>The team first traveled to New Haven to take on the top-seeded Bulldogs in a marquee matchup. Although Harvard fought til the very end, Yale held on just enough, coming away with a 13-12 win in the rivalry game. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>The following weekend, the Crimson hosted one of the top teams in the nation, No. 2 Boston College (13-2, 5-2 ACC). Having ample experience in a powerhouse conference, the local foe came out firing with power and never took its foot off the gas pedal. By the time the clock struck zeros, the Eagles found themselves emerging from the game with a 17-1 win. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Given the recent string of tough opponents and nail-biting finishes that just have not gone Harvard&rsquo;s way, the Crimson arrived in New York City searching for a much-needed victory. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>As the match began, Harvard jumped out to a quick start and found itself up 4-0 just under 10 minutes in, with the team eager to get back out on the field and prove itself after the last few games. Although the Lions were able to score two goals of their own, senior attacker Charlotte Clark was able to outduel the Lion goalie and squeezed in one last goal with a single second left in the first quarter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Entering the second frame, Harvard found itself with a solid 5-2 advantage. However, the Lions were determined not to go down without a fight. Mirroring the way the Crimson opened the game, Columbia came out hot in the second quarter, scoring three straight in less than five minutes. With the score now even, the two teams battled for the remainder of the half, each able to put up another goal before the match entered its midway point. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>As the teams came out for the third quarter, it was clear that Harvard had a resurgence of energy. Although the Lions were able to keep pace for a bit of time, the 6-6 tie was eventually snapped when the Crimson ripped off three straight goals. Two of these three were scored by sophomore midfielder Callie Hem &ndash; the team leader in goals scored (26) and in total points (34). </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although Columbia was able to notch one more goal with two minutes left in the quarter, which brought the score to a relatively close margin at 9-7, it was clear that there had been a significant momentum shift in Harvard&rsquo;s favor. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>This became abundantly clear at the onset of the final frame. Once again, the Crimson came out blazing, but also made sure to not leave the door open for the Lions to make a potential comeback. For the third time this game, Harvard put together an unanswered streak of goals, although this one happened to be the largest of the match at five (three of which came in the first five minutes), doubling the Lions&rsquo; total and stretching its lead to 14-7. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Before the final buzzer sounded, Columbia was able to score one last goal, but the Crimson still remained comfortably in control. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>As Harvard left New York City, the team returned to Cambridge with an impressive 14-8 victory, but, perhaps more importantly, the Crimson came home with a renewed sense of confidence. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>The team is going to need to carry this momentum into its final stretch of the regular season, which includes three games in a week&rsquo;s time, all at home. Harvard will first take on No. 12 Princeton (8-3, 3-0 Ivy League), another top-seeded opponent, this Saturday. Following this matchup, the Crimson has a three-day turnaround before Boston University (1-13, 0-7 Patriot League) travels across the Charles River for a Tuesday night competition. Finally, Harvard wraps up its regular season play with what is shaping up to be a vital game against Brown. Since the Bears are the team slated only slightly behind Harvard in the standings, it is likely that they will come out with everything they have, clawing for the fourth spot in the Ivy League. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is a high probability that these final games will determine whether or not the Crimson will get to experience postseason play, meaning that Harvard will need to play hard and smart at every junction, no matter if the opponent is highly ranked, such as Princeton, or struggling to accumulate wins, such as Boston University.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thus far in the season, the Crimson has proven that they can play with the best in the Ivy League, having lost by only one goal a piece to both top-seeded Yale and third-seeded Cornell. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>As Harvard enters this final stretch, the team is going to need to build on its win against Columbia; with three games to go, the Crimson controls its own postseason fate. </p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n&ndash;Staff writer Ben Morris can be reached at <a href=\"mailto:benjamin.morris@thecrimson.com\">benjamin.morris@thecrimson.com</a>.</p>", "created_on": "2022-04-22T03:20:29.529057Z", "slug": "wlax-2022-columbia", "contributors": [15]}}, {"model": "content.article", "pk": 14, "fields": {"title": "An Unlikely Cubicle", "text": "<p>{image id=1356031 size=large align=right byline=true caption=false}</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To most people, the stuff inside the boxes would be a complete mystery. Coils of blue translucent wires compressed at an angle, like a porcupine in its burrow. Peel-off fabric squares the size of a palm, meant to stick to skin like the quills of said porcupines. What appear to be either vape pens or souped-up Apple pencils stacked alongside capsules of clear liquid reflect the viewer&rsquo;s perplexed expression right back at them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But to Steven Garcia Machuca, these items were nothing other than the nectar of life &mdash; for millions of people with chronic disease, but particularly the uninsured people of the Bay Area who Steven&rsquo;s work serves. A student of public health and health policy, Steven is driven to address the problems of access to lifesaving medicine that haunt U.S. medicine. He understands the way that, if you don&rsquo;t have access to insurance, you do not have access to the medicine you need to survive. You see, Steven (like myself) lives with chronic disease, leveraging those experiences to cultivate the resourcefulness that led him to Harvard &mdash; and to the life of service he built outside of it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A first-generation American, Steven grew up in a small Colorado town on the outskirts of Aspen. Among the powder and privilege, he had a front-row seat to inequities of access from housing to healthcare. And he was determined to do something about it. Steven applied to Harvard, where he focused on studying History of Science and Global Health and Health Policy. He was determined to learn how discriminatory policies can be changed to promote healing and respect no matter what a patient&rsquo;s financial means. And when Harvard made students leave, Steven didn&rsquo;t see any reason to stop this work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Immediately after being kicked off campus, Steven returned to Colorado. There, he took on a role as a Covid-19 contact tracer for his local health department. Steven connected patients to rental assistance, food assistance, and medical relief programs. He realized how much misinformation was circulating about Covid-19 among his community. He learned how to listen compassionately, how to understand perspectives that, to most Harvard students, would feel illogical and worlds away. As one of the only contact tracers bilingual in English and Spanish, Steven poured his energy into ensuring that his community wasn&rsquo;t left behind amidst ever-changing covid information and policy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the same time, Steven was a Harvard student fully immersed in his Canvas classes, on top of simultaneously studying for the rigorous Crimson EMS program. The burnout was extreme, but he needed the school health insurance: if he were to take a leave, he wouldn&rsquo;t be able to afford the medicine he needed for daily survival. So in an effort to combat some of that burnout, Steven took his $5,000 housing stipend and rented a cubicle at his local WeWork. Rarely does anyone aspire to have a cubicle, but for Steven, it was a place of much-needed separation between school, work, and home life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And yet, working a full-time job while being an online student can only be sustainable for so long. But to take time off, Steven would need to solve the health insurance problem. After untold hours of research, cover letters, and interviews, he landed a job with HealthCorps (a program of AmeriCorps) in San Francisco. In addition to health benefits, the position came with a stipend to cover living expenses. Not to mention, the role could not be more ideally aligned with Steven&rsquo;s mission and values: Steven works as a diabetes care coordinator, improving outcomes for underserved patients with chronic disease. He supports a program called Healthright 360 &mdash; one of the few in the country that doesn&rsquo;t turn away anyone because of their inability to pay. There, Steven distributes medical supplies for survival for free to uninsured and underinsured patients. He also provides educational programming and boxes of fresh fruits and vegetables from the &ldquo;food pharmacy,&rdquo; free of charge for anyone who needs them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As Steven shares his story, I can feel the glow in his face down the phone line. I can hear us both think how, in a slightly different life, we would be the ones receiving the emergency medical supplies &mdash; at least, we hope we would have access to a program like this one.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At that moment, feeling very much &ldquo;at the mercy of geography and whether it shines or rains,&rdquo; in the words of Tenille Townes, I can feel our alternative lives pulsing beneath the surface. It&rsquo;s not something we think of often. At Harvard, we push them down deep, transcending their tragedies of inaccess through our relentless resourcefulness. But through our hard work and creativity, our not-a-moment&rsquo;s hesitation to grasp at any opportunity that comes our way, we have the courage at moments like these to reflect.

Now, the city faces the daunting task of deciding where it goes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Following the passage of the American Rescue Plan Act, signed into law by President Joe Biden in March 2021 to boost the economy, Cambridge was awarded $65 million directly from the federal government and $23 million through an intermediary statewide fund.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So far, the city has spent about $33 million of the relief funds on government projects, including meals and housing for unhoused Cambridge residents, Covid-19 testing and vaccines, and <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2022/2/25/cambridge-covid-restaurant-relief/\">relief grants for small businesses and restaurants</a>. At a meeting of the City Council Finance Committee on Wednesday afternoon, residents and representatives from local nonprofits made speeches asking the Council for a slice of the remaining $55-million pie.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During the meeting, Assistant City Manager David J. Kale said 40 community groups and nonprofits have applied to the city for funding so far, with requests totaling upwards of $180 million.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The bulk of this total comes from requests from the Cambridge Housing Authority, the non-profit that runs public housing in the city. In its requests, the CHA recommended spending up to $29.6 million on social services for CHA residents and infrastructure and planning costs related to new public housing projects.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This sum includes a $9 to $18 million expansion of Cambridge RISE, <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2021/4/19/cambridge-guaranteed-income-pilot/\">a guaranteed income pilot program</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During the Wednesday meeting, Cambridge Mayor Sumbul Siddiqui reiterated the Council&rsquo;s support for using ARPA funds for a larger guaranteed income program. In February, the Council unanimously voted to request policy options from the City Manager on using ARPA funds for direct payments to Cantabridgians &ldquo;facing eviction, housing instability, and/or homelessness.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The CHA also filed a request for up to $54 million &mdash; nearly all the city&rsquo;s remaining funds &mdash; to be allocated toward the construction of 128 new units of affordable public housing at two sites in the city. During the meeting, Michael J. Johnston, the executive director of the CHA, described the request as a &ldquo;placeholder,&rdquo; giving the Council the option to allocate any amount of funds toward public housing construction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Other large funding requests include $6 million for improvements and green space near Jerry&rsquo;s Pond in North Cambridge; $15 million to provide housing stipends to unhoused people through the non-profit Project Right to Housing; $2 million for an equity fund investing in businesses owned by racial minorities; and $5.5 million for Cambridge HEART, a community-based public safety <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2022/1/27/cambridge-considering-policing-alternatives/\">alternative to policing</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On May 2, according to Kale, the city will take a &ldquo;strategic pause&rdquo; on accepting proposals to sort through existing applications and evaluate their eligibility for funding.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the meeting, Councilor and Finance Committee co-chair Patricia M. &ldquo;Patty&rdquo; Nolan &rsquo;80 said that though there are &ldquo;many, many excellent proposals,&rdquo; not all will receive funding.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;As difficult as it is to understand that money is limited, we have more worthy projects than we can possibly fund,&rdquo; Nolan said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&mdash;Staff writer Elias J.

Its expansion into Allston has not come without its downsides, but it has ushered in vast strides toward ameliorating those tensions. Those strides are neatly packaged in one overarching program, the <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2022/4/13/ed-portal-allston/\">Harvard Ed Portal</a>, that indulges students and Allston residents alike. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>We would first like to applaud Harvard&rsquo;s efforts. We are heartened to hear that Allston residents themselves find value in the Ed Portal &mdash; at the end of the day, that&rsquo;s what matters most. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The program <a href=\"https://edportal.harvard.edu/program-areas\">supplies</a> a broad range of opportunities, such as workforce training, partnerships with public schools, and tutoring positions for Harvard students. This breadth excites us, and we are especially grateful for Harvard&rsquo;s emphasis on, inclusion, and valuing of trade-based work.     </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>However, our major concern regarding Harvard&rsquo;s involvement in Allston has been <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2018/5/7/editorial-harvard-in-allston/\">gentrification</a>. Residents have repeatedly raised concerns about the rising cost of living and the displacement of longtime community members. Ultimately, Allston&rsquo;s residents, not Harvard, should be at the center of this discussion. We caution against any dialogue that would suggest otherwise, framing Harvard as an all-knowing savior institution. That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s so important Harvard gets this right. This doesn&rsquo;t, on its own, absolve them of the harms of gentrification, but placing Allston&rsquo;s community at the forefront of their endeavors is the kind of thing that contributes to outweighing those harms. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The Ed Portal is exactly what we envisioned when we <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2022/4/8/editorial-fin-aid-expansion/\">called</a> for Harvard to start battling educational inequity long before they begin reviewing applications. Too often, one side of the conversation demands that universities repair America&rsquo;s economic inequality in one fell swoop by allocating social mobility to those who enter their doors. Their partners, conversely, contend that inequity begins long before universities can intervene, excusing themselves from solving America&rsquo;s problem. This kind of free educational outreach from Harvard &mdash; a leading university &mdash; threads the needle. Education is only socially valuable when as many people as possible have access to it. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>We also hope that Harvard&rsquo;s students will play an important role in Allston. Organizations on campus such as the Phillips Brooks House Association have <a href=\"https://www.pbha.org/programs\">collaborated</a> with public schools for a long time, building valuable relationships through afterschool and mentorship programs. Harvard should model their own pursuits after the successes of its students. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Reciprocally, its students should eagerly get involved with the Ed Portal. If you come to Harvard uncertain of your life aspirations, the natural grooves to fall into are pre-professional. Manifold powerful companies spend considerable time and money making this an easy track for us to follow. Like these career-oriented cultural impulses, participating in these outreach programs must become a norm that Harvard students default to. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Not only will student engagement strengthen the Ed Portal, but we are confident that those who join will find the experience fruitful. As Harvard cuts back on its teaching programs &mdash; like UTEP and GenED 1076 &mdash;it should encourage its students to learn what it is to be an educator by taking part in the Ed Portal&rsquo;s educational programming. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>We&rsquo;re glad to see Harvard taking strides in the right direction, and we hope to see more in the future. More apparency of the Ed Portal&rsquo;s accessibility for Allston residents who may be turned off by the Harvard name. More financial investment in the program. More student involvement. And most importantly, more inclusion of those who call Allston home.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><em>This staff editorial solely represents the majority view of The Crimson Editorial Board.

My childhood was filled with snow, negative temperatures, and ice; I grew up in the cold. I figure skated avidly from the age of three. But my devotion to the chilly sport and fond relationship with winter weather came to a screeching halt after my diagnosis in November of 2020. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Here&rsquo;s my story: what it&rsquo;s like to be literally allergic to the cold. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>During a routine figure skating rehearsal, I noticed red, itchy bumps forming on my legs and hands. I didn&rsquo;t think too much of it until the next day, when I opened my window to get some fresh air, and the hives reappeared. Occurrences like this continued, but I wasn&rsquo;t positive about the cause until two weeks later when I used an ice pack on my leg. Hives immediately formed in the exact shape of the ice pack on my skin. I saw a doctor the next day, who diagnosed my condition with an ice cube on my forearm. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>I have a rare form of <a href=\"https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/diseases/6131/cold-urticaria\">cold urticaria</a>. My body reacts to cold exposure as though it were an allergen. For some people, this reaction can be minor, and lead only to itchy hives. My severity level is unfortunately much worse. While I do get skin welts and hives, I am also susceptible to anaphylaxis, shock, hypotension, and hypothermia. If I were to fall into the Charles River, it could be fatal. Not only does my body react to the cold, but it retains it. Even as my body reheats, or moves into a warm environment, the ice in my veins remains. I have to actively warm my skin, either through flaming showers or layers of blankets, to free myself from the cold. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Anything less than my internal body temperature can cause a reaction. The weather outside may not always seem cold, but it can still give me hives. Lower temperatures are of course more dangerous, but even the warmer days can be a struggle. Sometimes, I venture out in full winter gear on a &ldquo;warm&rdquo; day, collecting stares and laughter from people as I pass. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Now, I carry an EpiPen and inhaler with me everywhere I go. The medical alert tag around my neck displays in bold letters: COLD ANAPHYLAXIS. I show up to lectures in a bright yellow snowsuit and sit through discussion sections clutching hand warmers. I get strange stares and whispered comments frequently. I do my best to ignore them. It&rsquo;s not always so easy, though. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s one thing to live with the physical realities of my condition &mdash; the psychological toll is another deal entirely. Trying to explain why I can&rsquo;t catch an Annenberg brunch with friends on a cold day. Zooming in to classes when it&rsquo;s raining. The &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t go out with you tonight, it is too cold for my body to handle.&rdquo; Sleeping through club meetings on the weekends because I had to take an emergency super-antihistamine that knocked me out for 16 hours. Cooping myself up in my dorm to wait out two days of a blizzard. The looks of disbelief when I tell people, &ldquo;I am literally allergic to the cold.&rdquo; I understand the doubt. Sometimes, I can&rsquo;t believe it either. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>I don&rsquo;t know if this condition will ever go away, but I don&rsquo;t have much hope. Doctors still have no idea why this hit me so abruptly after years of living in the cold. There is no cure, and the treatments only add to the psychological toll of my abnormal life. All I can do is adapt and surround myself with people who understand. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The next time you look out your window to a frosty Cambridge day, you may mull over grabbing a sweater or jacket, or dread the frigid walk to class. On these days, I wake up and wonder if today&rsquo;s the day I freeze to death &mdash; literally.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><em>Gracia A.

Nozzolillo, the double-count limitation means that students may not concurrently pursue two concentrations that have significantly overlapping coursework.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>More information on double concentrations will be forthcoming in the 2022-2023 College Handbook, she added.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Many students welcome the new option, saying it may affect their chosen course of study.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jonathan Y. Fu &rsquo;25 said he is now considering pursuing a double concentration in Physics and Classics.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;It seems like something Harvard should have done a while ago, but I&rsquo;m happy that they got it done this year,&rdquo; he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Before the double concentrations plan was passed, Fu said he was most likely going to concentrate in Physics with a secondary in Classics, since combining the two fields in a joint thesis &ldquo;would be pretty difficult.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Glen Liu &rsquo;25 said he thinks many people who were considering a joint concentration did so because it was the only option for them if they were interested in two different fields.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;I think that a significant portion of people who are planning to or originally planned to do a joint concentration will do a double concentration,&rdquo; he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Paul Yang &rsquo;25 said he is considering concentrating in both Computer Science and either Mechanical or Electrical Engineering. He formerly considered pursuing a secondary in Computer Science but said he prefers being able to explore more courses with a double concentration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;With a secondary you only take four classes, so you&rsquo;re not getting that much of an experience in CS,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;There are so many CS courses at Harvard, and it&rsquo;s so difficult to find the four that you&rsquo;re really interested in.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the other hand, Yang said he would need more information about how the College would count his credits when the two concentrations have more than two overlapping required courses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;CS and Engineering, both of those course loads are very similar in terms of the classes that you need to take,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just curious how that&rsquo;s going to balance out or how that&rsquo;s going to affect the concentrations.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nonetheless, Yang said he counted himself &ldquo;lucky&rdquo; because as a freshman, he has space left in his schedule to accommodate a potential double concentration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dora Ivkovich &rsquo;24, on the other hand, said she believes it would be infeasible for her as a sophomore to now change her course of study to a double concentration in Mathematics and Economics.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Given that we&rsquo;ve already done four semesters, unless I did three math classes for one or two semesters, it&rsquo;s just not doable, honestly,&rdquo; Ivkovich said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Eric A. Forteza &rsquo;24, who declared a joint concentration in Government and History, said he would have considered a double concentration more seriously if the option were available to him as a freshman.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;I think I would have taken a more equal balance of History and Government because right now, I&rsquo;ve taken more Government classes than History,&rdquo; he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Forteza added that for him, pursuing a double concentration now would restrict the number of electives he would be able to fit into his schedule.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;With the double concentration, I would have had to take 23 classes, and I would just have had no time to take any other electives,&rdquo; he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&mdash;Staff writer Ariel H.
